# Coaching-website-
An institutional website with the frontend and a login form. 

Using the Apache NetBeans 14 IDE, I created this institutional website project, which I ran on the Glassfish server (You can use any other sever to run, just you have to configure it in the project settings before deploying it). 
It makes use of the MySQL database. 
The database query is contained in the zip file; simply import it into phpmyadmin, and you're ready to go:)
